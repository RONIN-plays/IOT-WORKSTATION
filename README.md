🏙️ AIoT-Based Cognitive City System
An Intelligent, Connected Urban Ecosystem Powered by AI + IoT

The AIoT-Based Cognitive City System is an engineering project that integrates Smart Grids, Environmental Intelligence, and Human-Centric Buildings into one unified urban platform.
This system enables cities to sense, think, and act — improving sustainability, safety, comfort, and operational efficiency.

🚀 Project Overview

A Cognitive City seamlessly connects devices, sensors, and AI models to make autonomous decisions.
This system is built around three interconnected smart subsystems:

Smart Energy Grid (Self-Balancing Grid)

Air Quality + Weather Intelligence System

Emotion-Aware Smart Building Automation

Each subsystem works independently but also communicates through a unified AIoT cloud layer, enabling full-city cognitive behavior.

📌 Key Features
🔌 1. Smart Energy Grid (Self-Balancing Grid)

Predicts electricity demand using ML

Balances load dynamically between sources

Detects anomalies (fault, overloading, theft)

Auto-controls switching for optimal usage

Integrates solar/renewable data

🌫️ 2. Air Quality & Weather Interaction System

Real-time AQI monitoring (PM2.5, PM10, CO₂, NOₓ, SO₂)

Weather sensing (temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind)

Predicts pollution spikes

Suggests health alerts

Auto-adjusts ventilation systems and alerts nearby buildings

🏢 3. Emotion-Aware Smart Building Automation

Camera + AI models detect mood/emotions

Lighting, HVAC, and ambience adjust to user comfort levels

Predictive comfort model using environmental & physiological cues

Energy optimization while maintaining human comfort
